    <h1> Colorful music, conveying the feelings of musician Nguyen Thanh Trung</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row"></div> 
        <div class="col-lg-12">Initially, the CD consisted of only eight songs, of which two new songs were "Lonely", "I will come as dawn", six previous works were known to the audience through performances and music products. The singers' music is "Away from you", "House", "Old Hanoi", "Nostalgia 2", "Back to the sea", "Dye Afternoon". People's Artist Quoc Hung said: Close to the date of implementation, musician Nguyen Thanh Trung brought to his editor and music director two hot songs that had just been released: "Autumn missed the appointment", "Thu pay back". for life”. In which "Autumn missed the appointment" was requested by Nguyen Thanh Trung himself to invite singer Quang Ha to sing.</div>
    <div class="col-lg-12" > <img src="../img/316982234_1295870464580350_5663513078471578211_n (1).jpg" width="80%" height="600px"></div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">“Lost on the old one-way street. The withered street carried the sun into the night. The yellow leaves are gradually tinged with red blood. Autumn has entered the sad and lonely September" - beautiful lyrics like a love poem, full of sadness about a lost love. Nguyen Thanh Trung used many expensive words, evoking images (The withered street carries the sun in the night. The yellow eagle leaves are gradually tinged with red blood), evoking sounds (The shadow of someone is shaking during the long night), evoking feelings of sadness. regretting "the full moon but the heart is missing" in the hearts of listeners when everyone has had an unsuccessful love affair. Therefore, just reading the part of the lyrics was overflowing with emotions.</div>
    <div class="col-lg-12">Quang Ha herself is a very emotional singer. Perhaps that is why, Nguyen Thanh Trung targeted him for this song. Before that, People's Artist Quoc Hung also told Quang Ha about the situation, the story "Autumn missed the appointment" was born. “When choosing singers to sing for Trung, I told all the stories and plots Trung wrote, including with Quang Ha, so that even though the time was very short, she sang like a gut and a gut in the work Thu Miss. appointment" - People's Artist Quoc Hung said. Quang Ha's longing and tormenting sadness is clearly expressed through her warm, experienced voice. People's Artist Quoc Hung said he was very satisfied with the performance of his beloved student.</div>
    <div class="col-lg-12">The arrangement was assigned to musician Ha Trung, a very neat and sophisticated person. People's Artist Quoc Hung also implanted more strings and guitars to increase the sensitivity of the music. "Missing the appointment" is a beautiful, luxurious song that is equally catchy and easy to listen to, suitable for the mood of many people before the unfinished love affair, creating a highlight for the CD "Away from you" and is predicted to become Quang Ha's new hit in the near future.</div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">"Away from you" - 10 songs with 10 different colors is a new step in the career of a side-by-side musician, marking a change in the quality of Nguyen Thanh Trung. If “First Love” (2014) is all about the major voice praising the homeland, the country, the love of couples and the love of parents for their children, “Nostalgia” (2016) includes works For secondary products such as nostalgia for the years of youth, studying with friends, and first love with many difficulties, "Away from You" (2022) is colorful, including the convergence of folk, auditorium, with The song carries deep lyrics, bold philosophy of life about love and life, conveys the feelings and confidants of a multi-talented, multi-amorous man. "The album "Away from You" is diverse and new, also written about love and homeland, but shows the newness, experience and maturity of Trung" - People's Artist Quoc Hung commented.</div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">Like the songs on the album "Away from you", "I will come like dawn" by musician Nguyen Thanh Trung has a unique and unique way of telling a story - Telling with a vibration from the heart, so it has been touched. the depths of the listener's mind. It is no longer the author's own or someone's own love story, but the eternal sobbing of many sympathetic hearts.</div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">True love is always like that, always making people go through many levels of passion, thinking and even suffering. But what remains in the end are still moments of sublimation in the magical light that shines like illumination, opening the way for the journey of human life. Without love, without those uplifting moments, this life would be so tasteless. And love makes the eyes of lovers see life more beautiful, grateful and want to share and spread the happiness they have. Those are the values, the beautiful reasons of life that without love and affection, we will not be able to feel. Understanding that, musician Nguyen Thanh Trung breathed his soul into a song rich in metaphors. With the warm and emotional voice of Meritorious Artist Hoang Tung, the song really touches people's hearts.</div>
